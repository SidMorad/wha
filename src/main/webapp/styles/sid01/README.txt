'sid01' is a theme base on CSS Framework :   

At First I heard about CSS Framework in Matt Raible's weblog: 
http://raibledesigns.com/rd/entry/css_framework_design_contest

Then I read more about this CSS Framework :
http://www.contentwithstyle.co.uk/content/a-css-framework

And in this project I created my own theme (sid01).
CSS Framework have new BSD terms, which are about as open as they come .
I put below comment on all css files :
/* A CSS Framework by Mike Stenhouse of Content with Style - customized by Saeid Moradi*/

*my name is Saeid Moradi :)
*if you like use this theme , is better keep above comment and only change my name to yours ;-)
